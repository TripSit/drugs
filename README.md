# How to modify the drug/combo database

## Do your research.

No changes will be accepted without a reference to a reliable source. Studies are preferred to be cited in APA 7 format. Tools like Zotero can assist formatting.

Reliable sources include:

* .edu or .gov websites
* peer-reviewed research studies
* books
* journals
* credible harm reduction organizations
* etc.

We're actively gathering trip reports for the combinations on our current drug combination chart and for the four additional ones we plan to be adding. While we are prioritizing collecting these reports, we're open to receiving reports of any combinations.

## Create a pull request.

If you are familiar with GitHub, you can fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

If you are NOT familiar with GitHub, don't worry! You can propose a change in less than 5 minutes:

1. Navigate to the file you want to edit, likely drugs.json or combos.json.
1. Click the pencil icon under "history" to edit the file.
1. Make your changes. You may want to copy into an external text editor like Notepad++ and paste it back into GitHub.
1. Click the green "Commit changes" button at the top right of the page.
1. In the modal, update the commit message to describe your changes. For example, "Modified dosage on LSD".
1. In the modal, update the extended description with your sources/references.
1. In the modal, click the "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" radio button.
1. (Optional) In the modal, name your new branch. For example, "LSD dosage change".
1. Click the green "Propose changes" button.

This will send an alert to the team, who will review the changes and merge them into the database.

# TripSit Combination Chart Expansion

It has been a while since the TripSit drug combination chart had a substantial update. New substances have risen in popularity and drug interaction information is lacking. There is currently no good way to modify the TripSit database. We plan to fix all of that. 

We’re creating a process that allows people to suggest changes to the TripSit database. The priority will be to add combo information, but this process will apply to all database information. 

There are multiple things that will be done through the project, they are as follows:
* Add “DPH” “Mephedrone/4mmc” “Pregabalin” "Lithium" to the combo chart
* Code needs to be cleaned up
* Website interface development
* Adjustments Combo chart generator needs to be updated 
* Typescript conversion from JavaScript
* Database/architecture work
* Dynamic custom chart

## Interaction Suggestion Template**
```
X Substance + Y Substance = Z Interaction
Interaction Type (Caution, Unsafe, etc)
Message (There is a risk of seizures with this combination)
Sources: Clinical studies, case reports, meta-analysis, etc
*Reasoning (additional reasoning may be pharmacological explanations, externally related factors, etc)
```

## Drug Category Definitions
```
Low Risk & Synergy - These drugs work together to cause an effect greater than the sum of its parts, and they aren't likely to cause an adverse or undesirable reaction when used carefully. Additional research should always be done before combining drugs.
Low Risk & No Synergy - Effects are just additive. The combination is unlikely to cause any adverse or undesirable reaction beyond those that might ordinarily be expected from these drugs.
Caution - These combinations are not usually physically harmful, but may produce undesirable effects, such as physical discomfort or overstimulation. Extreme use may cause physical health issues. Synergistic effects may be unpredictable. Care should be taken when choosing to use this combination.
Unsafe - There is considerable risk of physical harm when taking these combinations, they should be avoided where possible.
Dangerous - These combinations are considered extremely harmful and should always be avoided. Reactions to these drugs taken in combination are highly unpredictable and have a potential to cause death.
