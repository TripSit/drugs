# TripSit Combo Chart Expansion

It has been a while since the combo chart had a substantial update. New substances have risen in popularity and combo information is lacking. There is currently no good way to modify the TripSit database. We plan to fix all of that. 

We’re creating a process that allows people to suggest changes to the TripSit database. The priority will be to add combo information, but this process will apply to all database information. 

There are multiple things that will be done through the project, they are as follows:
* Add “DPH” “Mephedrone/4mmc” “Pregabalin” "Lithium" to the combo chart
* Code needs to be cleaned up
* Website interface development
* Adjustments Combo chart generator needs to be updated 
* Typescript conversion from JavaScript
* Database/architecture work
* Dynamic custom chart
